Through regular studio sessions, B2B sets with other DJs, and hands-on practice on CDJs, I have continuously refined my technical skills and musical identity. Having already gained live experience playing at rooftop parties in Barcelona, Nubar on Christmas Day 2025 and the Pav at Trinity College Dublin, I am now looking to establish myself as a DJ in the underground electric music scene of Dublin. This year, I joined the DCU DJ Society as a Subcommittee member, further deepening my involvement in the local DJ community.\nMy sound is rooted in the underground electronic music scene, with a strong focus on:\n\nHard Groove\nSchranz\nHard Bounce\n\nCurrently, I am organising “GB SOC: NEXT GEN NOISE”, a party concept designed to provide emerging DCU DJs with a platform to showcase their talent while creating an energetic and memorable night for students and electronic music enthusiasts.\n\n\nSets\n\nSchranz Set • Fiore\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe cover is the Soundcloud link!"
