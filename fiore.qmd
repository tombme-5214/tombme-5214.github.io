### DJ Alias
**Fiore** is my DJ & Producer alias, rooted in my last name Blume, which means flower in German. 
A close Italian friend nicknamed me Fiore *(the Italian word for flower)*. 
I liked its sound of it and I used it as my alias.

## DJing
### About
I have been DJing for the past two years, starting on a Pioneer DDJ-FLX4 controller and progressively advancing to confidently perform on full Pioneer club setups. 
Through regular studio sessions, B2B sets with other DJs, and hands-on practice on CDJs, I have continuously refined my technical skills and musical identity. 
Having already gained live experience playing at rooftop parties in Barcelona, Nubar on Christmas Day 2025 and the Pav at Trinity College Dublin, I am now looking to establish myself as a DJ in the underground electric music scene of Dublin. 
This year, I joined the DCU DJ Society as a Subcommittee member, further deepening my involvement in the local DJ community.

My sound is rooted in the underground electronic music scene, with a strong focus on:

  * Hard Groove
  * Schranz
  * Hard Bounce

Currently, I am organising “GB SOC: NEXT GEN NOISE”, a party concept designed to provide emerging DCU DJs with a platform to showcase their talent while creating an energetic and memorable night for students and electronic music enthusiasts.

# Producing
### About

Next to DJing, I’ve recently started producing my own music to accelerate my skills and infuse my mixes with a more personal sound. 
I use Ableton Live and have purchased several sample packs to get started. 
At the end of January, I published my first track, “Turn It Up!!!” *(Schranz mix)* on SoundCloud for listening. 
I’m currently focusing my production skills on Schranz and Hard Groove, working on multiple Ableton projects, and hoping to release a new track soon.
